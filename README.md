This is a Script in order to push notifications for sites dropping the latest shoes. 

Most shoe sites with waiting rooms use a javascript to load the html. 

Selenium is used to load a browser and .get the html for the site. 

Beautiful soup (bs4) is used to scrape. 

If the site is not using javascript, bs4 is the only additional library needed.
